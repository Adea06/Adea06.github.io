## Data Science Projects

This page highlights a collection of data science projects I am completing over the next few weeks. They cover quick analytical tasks, NLP, machine learning workflows, and industry-based simulations. My focus throughout these projects is on clarity, reproducibility, and producing insights that matter.

---

### **1. Fixing a Misleading Chart (Quick Project)**  
A short project where I find an example of a poorly designed or misleading chart online, explain why it’s inaccurate, and recreate a clearer version using Python or R. The aim is to demonstrate good visual judgement and clean communication of data.

**Deliverables:**  
- Original chart  
- Three reasons it is misleading  
- Recreated chart with correct scaling and design  
- Short explanation of visual choices  

---

### **2. Word Frequency & Text Cleaning**  
Using real customer reviews (Amazon/Netflix/Hotels), I clean the text, remove noise, and explore the most common words using tokenisation and frequency tables.

**Deliverables:**  
- Cleaned text examples  
- Top word frequencies  
- Visualisation of common terms  

---

### **3. Sentiment Scoring of Reviews**  
Building on the previous project, I apply sentiment scoring tools (VADER/TextBlob) to classify reviews as positive or negative and analyse sentiment patterns.

**Deliverables:**  
- Sentiment polarity scores  
- Distribution of positive/negative reviews  
- Key words linked to each sentiment  

---

### **4. Sentiment-Based Machine Learning Classifier**  
A small end-to-end NLP project where I train a simple ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) to classify reviews automatically using TF-IDF features.

**Deliverables:**  
- Train/test pipeline  
- Accuracy and evaluation metrics  
- Confusion matrix  
- Interpretation of model features  

---

### **5. British Airways – Data Science Simulation (Forage)**  
An applied analytics project focusing on customer behaviour and segmentation. I explore patterns in customer data and produce insights that support strategic decision-making.

**Deliverables:**  
- Exploratory analysis  
- Customer insights  
- Optional machine learning segmentation  
- Summary of recommendations  

---

### **6. Lloyds Banking Group – Data Science Simulation (Forage)**  
A practical financial data project involving modelling, risk analysis, and interpreting model results in a business context.

**Deliverables:**  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Machine learning model  
- Performance evaluation  
- Business-focused interpretation  

---

### **7. Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Simulation (Forage)**  
A consulting-style project completed through Forage, focused on data analysis, interpretation, and business problem-solving. This project emphasises clear communication, data-backed recommendations, and structured thinking.

**Deliverables:**  
- Problem analysis  
- Data exploration  
- Key findings and insights  
- Recommendations presented in a consulting format  

---

### **8. Book Recommendation System (Goodreads Dataset – R)**  
A more advanced project where I build a recommendation system using a Goodreads dataset. This includes preparing a user–item matrix, modelling user preferences, and generating personalised book suggestions.

**Deliverables:**  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory analysis  
- User-based and item-based collaborative filtering  
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, precision@k)  
- Recommended books for sample users

More projects will be added as I continue expanding the portfolio.
